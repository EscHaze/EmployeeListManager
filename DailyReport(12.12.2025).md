# What I did
Today I set up the initial console application for the AssistLabTask1 project and created the main interaction loop using C# and Spectre.Console for colored terminal output. The program now displays a menu of employee‑related actions (add, list all, list remote, find by ID, exit) and safely validates user input so that empty or whitespace commands are rejected with a clear error message. The structure includes a dedicated GetInput helper and a switch‑based command dispatcher, which will serve as the backbone for future features.​

# What I will do
Tomorrow, the plan is to implement the underlying employee model and in‑memory storage (e.g., a list or collection) to hold employee records. On top of that, the menu options will be wired up: adding new employees, listing all employees, filtering remote employees, and searching by ID, along with any necessary validation and formatting.

# Blockets 
There are no major blockers right now.
