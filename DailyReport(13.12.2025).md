# What I did
Today I finished the main version of the AssistLabTask1 console app. The user can now add employees (with full name, optional position, validated hire date, and remote flag), and each employee gets an auto‑generated numeric ID. I also added commands to list all employees, show only remote workers, and find a specific employee by ID, all rendered in Spectre.Console table with messages for invalid input or when an employee isn’t found.
# What i will do
I will react to any comments and corrections that mentor provides and make adjustments if needed.
# Blockers
Currently none.
